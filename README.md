# Usage Instructions for Youtube Video Cutter v1.0

Overview:
This program allows you to download videos from various platforms (such as YouTube, Google Drive, Instagram, X, etc.) and then cut out only the parts you need—so you don't have to download the entire video and then edit it manually. You also have the option to download the full video in different resolutions.

Step 1: Load the Video

Paste the URL of the video in the "Video URL" field.

Click the "Load Video" button to extract the video information.

Note: The program does not automatically detect the URL; you must click "Load Video" after pasting the URL.
Step 2: Preview and Navigate

Once the video is loaded, it will be displayed in the integrated video player.

Use the timeline slider to navigate through the video. The timeline shows both the current playback time and the total duration.
Step 3: Select the Clip

Click the "Start Clip" button when you want to mark the beginning of the segment you wish to extract.

Click the "End Clip" button to mark the end of the segment.

The program will display the selected start and end times, so you know exactly which portion will be downloaded.

Step 4: Download Options

To download only the selected clip, click "Download Clip".

To download the entire video, click "Download Full Video".

Use the drop-down menus for playback resolution and download resolution to choose the desired quality.

Additional Notes:

For URLs from Google Drive, the program automatically converts them into direct download links.
Although the program was originally developed for YouTube, you can try it with other platforms. Results may vary depending on the source.
The language of the interface can be changed between Spanish and English using the language selector at the top-right corner.

**Performance Note:** Please note that the time required to download, cut, and process videos may vary depending on several factors, including the
**computer’s processing power**, **internet speed**, as well as the **duration and quality of the video**. 
Higher resolution videos or longer videos may take more time to download and process. If your computer or internet connection is slower, the process could be extended accordingly.
